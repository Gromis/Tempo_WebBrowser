# Tempo Web Browser

I started this project as I noticed that the current web browsers as taking a lot of resources, as they have a lot of functionality. I thought that I need something simple to use and as a temporary switch while I play games or do other work which requires a lot of resources, that is why I started this project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and ready to run, on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project uses PyQT5 and dark style theme for PyQT GUI, which is why if you want to run in it in your IDE, you would need to have those two installed. I would suggest using PyCharm as it easy to install packages there. The other imports are basic python built-in libraries.

## Running the tests

When you have the project on your device and running in one of Python IDE's, run the project and the web browser will open and you can test it out! Please note, that the built-in proxy is not yet finished, same as the settings tab!
